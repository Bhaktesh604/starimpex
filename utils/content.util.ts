      'Diamond carat weight is the measurement of how much a diamond weights. A metric "carat" is defined as 200 milligrams.',
      `Each carat can be subdivided into 100 'points.' This allows very precise measurements to the hundredth decimal place. A jeweler may describe the weight of a diamond below one carat by its 'points' alone. For instance, the jeweler may refer to a diamond that weights 0.25 carats as a 'twenty-five pointers.' Diamond weights greater than one carat are expressed in carats and decimals. A 1.08 carat stone would be described as 'one point oh eight carats.'`,
      `All else being equal, diamond price increases with diamond carat weight because larger diamonds are more rare and more desirable. But two diamonds of equal carat weight can have very different values (and prices) depending on three other factors of the diamond 4Cs: Clarity, Color, and Cut. It's important to remember that a diamond's value is determined using all of the 4Cs, not just carat weight.`,

      `Diamonds are stones formed in the earth under extreme pressure, these rocks when forming crack, cloud and spots of uncrystallized carbon can become trapped as black specks. Inclusions are not bad, and MOST diamonds have them in one form or another. Depending where the inclusions are, how many there are and of what type, they are often invisible to the unaided, untrained eye. Diamond clarity refers to the absence of these inclusions and blemishes. Diamonds without inclusions are very rare and are graded as IF or Internally Flawless. Inclusions do affect the value of the diamond, and can affect the stone's brilliance if the are grouped tightly together or if they are scattered throughout the diamond. The inclusions break up the light entering and leaving the diamond, making it less brilliant. SI2 and SI1 can be very clean and are the best value. VS diamonds will be more brilliant, and will sell for a higher price than the SI diamonds.`,

This factor refers to the quality of the diamond's cut, not the shape or size (although these can be interchangeable), and how well the stone is faceted, proportioned, and polished. This also determines how the diamond interacts with light. Brilliance, which is the diamond's ability to return light to the eye, is measured solely by the stone's cut (color and clarity have no impact). For any diamond shape, visually, cut is the first C to consider, followed by color, and, least as important, clarity (as long as the diamond has no visible imperfections).`,

During the design stages, the cutter will choose the best feasible diamond shapes in order to reduce waste and optimize the rough stone's output. To get precise measurements, the rough stone is often mapped with a Sarin machine. The marker, a highly experienced cutter who weighs all the factors and determines whether a diamond should be sawn or split into pieces, then marks exactly where the cuts should be made, performs these complex computations. This procedure might take months when dealing with huge, expensive gems.`,
